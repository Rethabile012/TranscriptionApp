chairperson chair honourable speaker in the previous yearâ€™s parliamentary budget vote speech i_letter described the chief whips forum as a soap opera because you could miss eight episodes and still be able to catch up with the storyline i_letter am happy to state that this forum has however become more efficient at dealing with issues and that thankfully the lead characters are no longer continuously replaced by new actors from the ruling party every few months this improvement has allowed us to build up a collegial spirit in the chief whips forum
